You may have one system-tags file per unix machine you use. 
Note that those files are not under version control due to their size.

If the file ~/.vim/system-tags/$(hostname) doesn't exist please generate one if you want to use system tags.

You can use the following command:
    ctags -R -f ~/.vim/system-tags/$(hostname) /usr/include /usr/local/include

This command may take a while.
